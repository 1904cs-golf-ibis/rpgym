# RPGym

RPGym is an app that combines gaming and fitness. By using a third-party fitness app called Strava, we take a user's exercise data and translate it to levels and stats for their very own RPG character. A user is then able to use this character battle other users in a turn-based, Pokemon-like battle. The ultimatel goal is to gamify fitness and incentivize gamers to go outside and get fit. Level up with RPGym!
